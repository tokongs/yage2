### Yet Another Game Engine 2

## Description

As with yage(1) this will also probably never be finished and I'll probably start yage3. 

This time I am going with Vulkan, so I guess this is mostly for learning Vulkan and may never actually be a game engine, but eather a rendering engine...

Using Premake5 to generate project files so hopefully it will be easy to devlelop on any platform. I have never used Premake5 so take that with a grain of salt.
